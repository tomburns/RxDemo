[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager used by this demo app to install all the dependencies (Rx, SnapKit...). First, make sure that CocoaPods is installed using the following command:

```bash
$ pod --version
1.3.1
$
```

If not, you can install it by running the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

When you have finished installing Cocoapads, go into the example app folder and run the following command:

```bash
$ pod update
```

This will install all of the necessary dependencies. 
After the dependencies are installed, you are good to go.
